>> Write a function that sums the numbers in a list but **only** if they are divisible by 2 
```python
list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
list_2 = [2,4,6,8]
list_3 = [1,3,5,7]
```

Assume that the length of the array is greater than or equal to 1. Use array.length when writing your response.
For example, given:


`divis_by_2(list_1)` should return 12
`divis_by_2(list_2)` should return 20
`divis_by_2(list_3)` should return 0
