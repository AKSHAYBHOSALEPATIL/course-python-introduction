### Dictionaries in Python

Dictionaries tend to be one of the most useful data structures in python. The true definition of a dictionary is:

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

A dictionary is the same as a hash table, which allows us to look up values based on a key.

```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"]) #prints out Ford
```
In the next slide we will explore more on how to create a dictionary and use it in our code.
