# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

This means that you can use the operators to manipulate variables in the same way that we talked about in the last lecture.


Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators


- Since we already looked at the Arithmetic Operators in the previous lectures, I will gloss over them here
 
Operator|Name|Example
|-|-|-|
|+|Addition|x + y|
|-|Subtraction|x - y
|*|Multiplication|x * y
|/|Division|x / y	|
|%|Modulus|x % y|
|**|Exponentiation|x ** y	 
|//|Floor division|x // y
