### Comparing Variables

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:


|   Operator  |   Description|   Example     |
|:------|:----|:-------|
|==|If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true|(2 == 3) returns `False`|
|!=	|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true| (2 != 3) returns `True`|
|<>|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true|(2 <> 3) is `True`. This is similar to != operator.|
|>|If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true|	(2 > 3) returns `False`|
|<|If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true|	(2 < 3) returns `True`|
|>=|If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true|	(2 >= 3) returns `False`|
|<=|If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true| (2 <= 3) returns `True`

```python
# is 2 less than 3?
print('Is 2 < 3? ', 2 < 3 )

# is 2 greater than 3?
print('Is 2 > 3? ', 2 > 3 )

# is 2 equal to 3?
print('Is 2 = 3? ', 2 == 3 )

# is 2 not equal to 3?
print('Is 2 != 3? ', 2 != 3 )
```
