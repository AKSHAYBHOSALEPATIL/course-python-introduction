### Re-Assigning values to Variables

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

`a = 5` is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable a on the left. There are various compound operators in Python like `a += 5 ` that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. pushtest

|   Operator   |   Implicit Example   |   Explicit Example    |   English Conversion|
|:------|:----|:-------|:-----------------|    
|=  | x = 5  | x = 5 |	Set equal to      |
|+= | x += 3 | x = x + 3| x equals x plus ...|
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 | x equals x minus ...|
| *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 | x equals x times ...|
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 | x equals x divided ...|
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 | x equals x modulus ...|
| //= | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 | x equals x integer division ...|
| **= | x **= 3 | x = x ** 3 | x equals x to the power of ...|

### Examples of using this

```python
# Declare the variable x
x = 5

# Update the variable
x += 5

# Print it
print(x)
```
