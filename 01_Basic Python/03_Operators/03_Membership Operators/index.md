### The **in** operator

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

Here are some examples of how you can use the in operator along with the **not** operator

```python
# Declare the list
lst = [1,2,3,4]

print('Is 4 in the list? ', 4 in lst) # Returns True
print('Is 5 in the list? ',5 in lst) # Return False


#Declare the string
string = 'Cats are cool and cuddly'

print('Is the word Cats in the string? ', 'Cats' in string)
print('Are the words Hellow World in the string? ','Hello World' not in string) 

```
