## Python Identity Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

Here are some examples of how you can use the in operator along with the **not** operator

```Python
lst = [1,2,3,4]

4 in lst # Returns True

5 in lst # Return False

string = 'Cats are cool and cuddly'

'Cats' in string # Returns True

'Hello World' not in string # Returns False

```
