# Algebra using python

Just like a calculator, python works well with numbers.  You can add variables together if they are the same type!

```python

# Assign x to be  = 2
x = 2

#Assign y = 2
y = 2

#print out the result
print(x + y)

```

- You can run this in python and it will print out 4 since 2 + 2 = 4


There are a multitude of other mathematical functions that you can use.  

- `*` = Multiplication
  - Can be used with floats and integers

- `+` = Addition
  - Can be used with floats, integers and _strings_

- `-` = Subtraction
  - Can be used with floats and integers

- `/` = Division
  - Can be used with floats and integers

#### Other functions:

- `**` = Exponential

- `//` Integer Division
  - Integer division is division in which the fractional part (remainder) is discarded is called integer division.

- `%` Modulus Division
  - In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus)
