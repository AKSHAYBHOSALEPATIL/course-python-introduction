### Floats
In python a float refers to a number that has decimal places.  

```python
x = 3.2
```

#### Official Definition:

**float (floating point real values)** âˆ’ Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).


If you add a float and an int together, it results in a float

```python
x = 3.2
y = 3
z = x+y
```

This will give you a new variable `z` which is equal to 6.2

Calling the function `float(number)` will turn an integer into a number that can contain decimal places.
