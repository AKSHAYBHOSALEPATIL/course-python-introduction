### Our first variable: Integers
In python an integer refers to a number that is does not have any decimal places.  Unlike other coding languages to initialize an integer, you just set a variable equal to a number that does not have a decimal.

```python
x = 36
```

#### Official Definition:

These are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.

You can add integers together which will result in another integer.

```python
x = 3
y = 6
z = x+y
print(z)
```

This will give you a new variable `z` which is equal to 9
